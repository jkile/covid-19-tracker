# Covid-19 Tracker
 
This is a simple COVID-19 tracker built in the very early days of the pandemic with data visualization powered by ChartJS and d3 with minor styling using TailwindCSS. Rather than tracking daily reported cases, this data shows an ongoing tally state by state of positive tests, negative tests, death counts, and total testing done in each state. The darker each state is on the map indicates that it has a proportionally higher running total of positive tests compared to other states. 

For more information, please take a look at the live app [here](https://covid-19-mapper.herokuapp.com/). Please note it is deployed to a free Heroku instance and may take moments to load.
